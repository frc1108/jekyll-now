Our GitHub pages website is made with Jekyll and a clone of the Jekyll-Now project. The source is public at <http://frc1108.github.com/frc1108.github.io>.  This site is a working laboratory designed to teach various tools in data science, programming, and web development.  

Our main site is <http://www.pantherrobotics.com>.

Our scouting and developer groups learn some of the basics of computer language, websites, data analysis, and robotic programming.  

## Roadmap for 2017 season (Scouting & Development)

At the start of a season, we set goals for the SD group.  For 2017, we have five ideas:

* Everyone can learn a skill
* We expect skills to progress
* Bring on the inspiration
* Data science is engineering
* Beyond the minimum standards

### Everyone can learn a skill
Having opportunities to learn a new computer skill is important for the development of every team member, and should begin in their first year.  Having this experience is something to build upon for some to become skillful for their future.  For others that might not find a passion, they will gain in technical literacy important to modern life for all people. more literate with technologyginning in the first year, all members should all have some time in computer task.

Generally, questions relevant to these goals are: 

* What should student learn in FIRST?
* What should the organization structure be?

Initial planning for the 2017 scouting and programming groups.  These skills are developed over time and getting new and old members up to speed and inspired to learn more about a language or skill is the goal of the team.  Leading up to build season we want to give opportunities to practice relevant skills.

One idea is to make a simple roadmap outlining the goals for the year in scouting and developing groups.  These skills take time to learn and practice and are best done in the months leading up to build season.  Setting realistic goals for the year is a real challenge and important to the success of these groups.

Preferably this should be done before the school year, and then used in the recruitment of students interested in programming.

## 2016 Summer code sessions

These sessions are small tasks meant to challenge you and improve your skills.  They are not homework or mandatory.  They are self-paced and self-directed.  You are encouraged to search out answers to questions along the way from your available resources.  Or asking for help from mentors.  

There are no set rules.  Explore everything or just the bare minimum.  Change the task and make it your own.  Write a new task, and share with everyone.  We are all together in learning.  

To encourage everyone, I've added dates to share progress and badges for completing the sessions.  

Documenting your session or project is important and makes sharing and working together possible.  I encourage everyone to create their own GitHub repository where they can save the files for sharing.  Following the first project you'll have a website like this one and a GitHub account.  Writing up your project or session in a blog post on that site is another good way to show off your project.  Although, I have to warn to be careful with personal information.  Other more private repositories (Bitbucket) or other sites like Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. can be used instead.
